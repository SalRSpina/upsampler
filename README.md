###Spectrogram Upscaling using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)###
##Overview##
This project is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for spectrogram upscaling. The goal of the project is to train a GAN model that takes a low-resolution spectrogram as input and generates a high-resolution spectrogram as output. The model is trained using a dataset of paired low-quality and high-quality spectrograms, and the generated high-resolution spectrograms are expected to be similar to the original high-quality spectrograms.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:
